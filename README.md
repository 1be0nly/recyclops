## Backgrounder
Waste management is an important issue facing many communities, and proper waste sorting is crucial for reducing contamination and promoting recycling. However, traditional waste sorting methods can be confusing and inconvenient for users, leading to contamination and reduced recycling rates. An application-based waste sorting system could provide a more efficient and convenient solution to this problem.

Waste management is a complex and challenging issue, with environmental, social, and economic implications.
